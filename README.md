GalaxyHud-Master

================

A Team Fortress 2 GUI built off of YaHud CMD while borrowing heavily from Garm3nHud TanLight and KBNHud. Aesthetically inspired by Taoism and a desire to create a truly original hud.

================

To customize the hud to your tastes simply open up the folder entitled "alternate files" and move the relevant .res file to your resource/ui folder and remove the suffix. For example, to use the quake live damage numbers move HudDamageAccount-quake.res and take out the 'quake', replacing the existing HudDamageAccount.res.

Further customization can be achieved through editing the files yourself, find more information at http://doodlesstuff.com/?tutorial=tf2hud.

Alternatively, if you ever have any issues with this hud please open up an issue report on GitHub, or, for more personal help, feel free to send me a PM on teamfortress.tv here: http://teamfortress.tv/user/profile/hanbrolo

A note about crosshairs: they WILL be misaligned depending on your resolution and aspect ratio, sorry about that. 

For more information regarding hud crosshairs check out the guide I wrote here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cpANKL3GRq7IcS3TzH2zD_59ydkU2QWNOuegmyzMxZU/edit

A quick disclaimer about updating: I'm not nearly as motivated to update this hud as I should be, sorry. I strongly encourage anyone who, like me, is a little bit OCD about their hud, to learn to modify their hud themselves through doodle's guide which I linked above.

This means that I won't make any promises about areas of the hud I don't use, such as MVM, Eureka Effect Menus, the Taunt Menus, being updated. Sorry.






This was mainly a project to get to understand the HUD editing process a little better, I'm not really happy with the end product in terms of usability but I am pleased with it aesthetically. 

Enjoy!
